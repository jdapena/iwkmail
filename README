iwkmail
-------

iwkmail is an experiment to create a hybrid application, combining a web based UI
and a GObject based application logic.

It uses:
* JQuery and JQuery-Mobile for UI side.
* WebKitGtk and Gtk for C/GObject side of UI.
* Camel as a mail protocols implementation.

Parts of code are derived from Modest Mail.

iwkmail stands for Igalia WebKit Mail.
